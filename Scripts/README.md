\# Netrix



Netrix is a beginner-friendly Pentesting and Vulnerability Management Toolkit written in Python.  

It is designed to demonstrate the key stages of penetration testing in a clear and easy-to-understand way.  

The toolkit is organized into four main areas:



\- \*\*Reconnaissance\*\* → subdomain enumeration, port scanning, WHOIS lookup  

\- \*\*Vulnerability Discovery\*\* → security header checks, SSL/TLS tests  

\- \*\*Exploitation (Safe Proof-of-Concepts)\*\* → simple XSS and SQLi checkers  

\- \*\*Reporting\*\* → save notes, merge results, generate simple reports
